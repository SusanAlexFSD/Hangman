Hangman (React)

A simple interactive Hangman game built with React. The game selects a random word, tracks player guesses, and updates the UI dynamically as the player reveals letters or makes mistakes. This project focuses on core functionality first, including state management, component structure, and game logic.

The visual styling is still in progress — the current priority was getting the game fully working before refining the CSS and overall design.
